    <p>It has gotten warmer. Winters have less snow here in new england. Our president doesn't know its real.</p>
    <p>We are on track for it to <em>continue</em> getting worse, but new people and orgs are being put in place all the time. Our president will hopefully not be able to keep preaching lies. We might not have any snow at all in new england.</p>

    <h2>ways to minimize climate change in the U.S.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>reduce waste</li>
        <li>use renewable energy sources</li>
        <li>eat less meat</li>
        <li>use cars less</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People are buying more and more electric cars. This will help the environment because there are significantly less fosil fuels being used in our every day lives. <br>There are also many groups of people who are trying to preserve things like oceans and forests.</p>

Thanks to President Biden’s leadership, we have been addressing the climate crisis with the urgency that it deserves, including <br>through historic investments that will make every community more climate resilient.”</blockquote>
